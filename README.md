👋 Hey there!
Welcome to my GitHub — where bugs are features and MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) is my daily grind. 😎

🎓 College student by day, MERN stack wrangler by night.
🐛 Creator of bugs, occasionally the fixer.
☕ Fueled by caffeine and Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V.
💡 Learning JavaScript while still trying to figure out what this actually does.
🔥 100% committed to writing clean code... unless StackOverflow is quicker.
🛠️ Tech I dabble in:
MERN stack + the usual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript trio.
